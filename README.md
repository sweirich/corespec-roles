This branch (main) includes the Coq proof development accompanying the paper 
"A Role for Dependent Types in Haskell", conditionally accepted to ICFP 2019.

- [src](src/FcEtt) for Coq development.

- [spec](spec/ett.ott) and (spec/ett.pdf) 
  for [Ott](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/) specification of the full system.

The prior development, corresponding to the ICFP 2017 paper, augmented with rules
for eta-equivalence, is available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/sweirich/corespec).
